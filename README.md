DESCRIPTION:This is a basic portfolio website built using only HTML and CSS, designed to showcase the work, projects, and contact information of a developer in a clean and professional manner. The project structure is simple and consists of an index.html file and a corresponding style.css file, both organized in a single portfolio/ folder. The website includes essential sections such as a welcome header with a developer introduction, an about section, a project showcase, and a contact area. The header features a profile image displayed in a circular format along with the developer’s name and role. The about section provides a brief description of the developer’s interests, skills, and current focus.

The project section showcases three sample projects, each described with a title and a short summary. These project cards are styled using CSS to appear visually distinct and structured. The contact section includes an email and a link to the developer’s GitHub profile. The site’s design uses modern web styling techniques with a clean layout, responsive elements, and consistent typography. CSS is used to style the layout, define padding, margins, colors, and to apply a responsive design. The header is optionally designed to support a background image that fills the entire width and height of the screen, giving it a hero-section appearance, with text overlay centered on the image. The profile image is styled using border-radius: 50% and object-fit: cover to ensure it appears perfectly round and maintains its aspect ratio. This portfolio project is suitable for beginners learning web development and also serves as a simple personal site template for developers looking to present themselves online. You can easily customize the content, colors, font styles, and even add more sections such as skills, testimonials, or a resume download button.

To run this project, simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser, or use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code for live preview. The entire website is static, meaning it does not require any backend server or database. This makes it easy to host for free on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. Overall, this project demonstrates foundational front-end development skills and emphasizes the importance of semantic HTML structure and reusable CSS styles. Future enhancements could include adding animations using CSS transitions or JavaScript, implementing a responsive navbar for mobile devices, integrating a contact form, or converting the project into a React-based single-page application for more advanced functionality. This portfolio site is intended as a starting point for any developer’s online presence and can be gradually expanded as the developer gains more experience and projects. Whether used in a resume, job application, or shared on social media, a clean and informative portfolio like this helps communicate your skills clearly to potential employers or collaborators. It also serves as a great hands-on exercise to practice real-world web design principles in a manageable and easy-to-understand project.
